# merge-sort
Code to sort an array of integers using merge sort techniques (need improvement)

The code works by getting a array of size N and use a recursion code to sort each half of the array.

The algorithm gets a O(nlogn) steps to sort the array, and take at least nlogn steps too.
The algorithm is better to sort completely randomyze arrays, but is unable to detect already sorted arrays.
